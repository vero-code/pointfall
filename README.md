The tunnel collapsed. The survivors are looking at you. The air is thick with dust, and panic is setting in. Can you make the right choices to lead them to safety?

**This 3D first-person narrative game was created for:**
* [Chroma Awards: AI Film, Music Videos, and Games](https://devpost.com/software/pointfall)
* [Giving Tuesday 2025 — Submit Your Game, Help a Child](https://itch.io/jam/gt2025)

### ✨ Features

- **First-Person Exploration:** Navigate a debris-filled room in 3D.

- **Full AI-Powered Audio:** Features AI-generated character voices and an original AI-generated ambient soundtrack.

## 🤖 AI Disclosure

This project heavily utilizes generative AI as a core part of the hackathon theme:

- **Text & Dialog:** All dialogue and story beats were co-written and edited with an LLM.
- **Voice Acting:** All character voices were generated via AI Text-to-Speech (CapCut).
- **Music:** The atmospheric background soundtrack was generated by Stable Audio.
- **3D assets:** 3D models and animations (Mixamo from Adobe), their conversion to .glb format (Blender, IMAGEtoSTL), and their compression (gltf-compressor).
